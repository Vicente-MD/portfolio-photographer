Passionate about art, I immerse myself in photography and cinema, in addition to nurturing my passion for music since I was young. These interests not only enrich my life but also shape my holistic view of medicine, inspiring me to integrate art and science into my future practice. I am excited about the prospect of exploring how these passions interconnect, enriching both my personal and professional life.",
